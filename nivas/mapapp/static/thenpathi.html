               Thenpathi town is a type of human settlement that is generally smaller than a city 
               but larger than a village, though definitions can vary by country and region.
               Towns typically have a diverse economy based on commerce, industry, and public services rather than agriculture,
               and are characterized by a mix of residential areas, shops, local businesses, and public amenities that foster 
               a sense of community among residents. The overall atmosphere of a town can range from bustling and vibrant to quiet 
               and peaceful, with many towns boasting unique cultural landmarks, green spaces, and local traditions.
