                Perumal temple is a sacred building used for worship and spiritual activities, serving as a house for deities and a focal point 
                for religious life within a community. While the term "temple" is used for Hinduism, Buddhism, and other faiths, the architecture and cultural significance of temples 
                vary widely across different regions and religions, often featuring elaborate sculptures, intricate carvings, and symbolic designs rooted in their specific traditions. 
                Devotees visit temples to connect with the divine through prayer, offerings, and rituals, finding a place of peace, refuge, and hope in challenging times.
