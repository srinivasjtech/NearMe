                Semmangudi village is a quiet and charming place located away from the busy city life. 
                Surrounded by vast fields and greenery, it offers a peaceful environment where the air is fresh, and the skies are clear. 
                The people in my village are kind and hardworking, mostly engaged in farming and agriculture. The houses are simple, some built with traditional materials like mud and bricks, 
                while others are more modern with concrete structures. Life here is slow-paced, and everyone knows each other.
